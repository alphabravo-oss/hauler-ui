# Changelog

All notable changes to Hauler UI will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — Multi-haul workspaces

Reworked the core model so a **haul** is now a first-class, isolated workspace
instead of a loose `.tar.zst` file. Multiple hauls can be built, edited, served,
and archived side by side without clearing or merging a shared store.

- **Isolated per-haul stores** — each haul owns its own OCI store directory
  (`/data/hauls/<slug>/store`); operations never affect other hauls.
- **Haul resource API** — `GET/POST /api/hauls`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/hauls/{id}`,
  and `GET /api/hauls/{id}/archives[/{file}]` for create/rename/delete plus
  per-haul archive listing, download, and delete.
- **Haul-scoped store operations** — add/sync/save/load/copy/remove/extract/info
  and serve all accept a `haulId` (body) or `?haul=` (query) and target that
  haul's store; they fall back to a seeded **Default** haul.
- **Exact provenance** — store contents are tracked per haul, replacing the
  digest/name-matching heuristic.
- **Per-haul serving** — registry/fileserver servers bind to a haul's store, get
  isolated backend directories, and are guarded against port collisions.
- **New UI** — a Hauls list and a tabbed haul workspace (Overview, Contents,
  Add Content, Archives, Serve) with an active-haul switcher in the top bar.
- **Per-haul manifest library** — saved manifests are owned by a haul; names are
  unique per haul and the Manifests page is scoped to the active haul.
- **Live haul stats** — the Hauls list and switcher poll so item and archive
  counts stay current after operations complete.
- **Clearer paths** — the Store page and Settings now show the active haul's
  isolated store directory and the per-haul hauls root instead of a single
  global store path.

- Job detail pages with full command and output

#### Authentication & Security
- Optional password-based UI access control (`HAULER_UI_PASSWORD`)
- Session management with 24-hour expiration

- Capabilities endpoint reporting Hauler CLI version
- Streaming log endpoints for real-time job output
- Archive download with range request support

#### Deployment
- Single-container Alpine-based Docker image
- Multi-stage build for minimal image size
- Docker Compose configuration with all ports exposed
- Environment variable configuration with defaults

- Persistence documentation explaining data storage
- Inline API documentation comments in Go backend

### Known Limitations
- Podman-generated tarballs are not supported for `store load`
- When copying to a registry path, login to the registry root first
- Large operations (sync, save) may require significant temporary space
- Self-signed certificates trigger browser security warnings
